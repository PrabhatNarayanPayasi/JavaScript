Practice Set 2
Ok everyone, now lets put our knowledge to the test. and try to solve the following questions.

Q1: Using Logical Operators
Create a JavaScript program to check if a age is between 10 and 20.

let age = prompt("Enter your age");
if (age >= 10 && age <= 20) {
  console.log("You are between 10 and 20");
} else {
  console.log("You are not between 10 and 20");
}
In this example, we use the && operator to check if the age is between 10 and 20. If the age is between 10 and 20, the condition evaluates to true, and the first console.log statement is executed. If the age is not between 10 and 20, the condition evaluates to false, and the second console.log statement is executed.


Q2: Using Switch Case
Demonsrate the use of switch case in JavaScript.


Q3: Divisible by 2 and 3
Create a JavaScript program to check if a number is divisible by 2 and 3.


Q4: Divisible by 2 or 3
Create a JavaScript program to check if a number is divisible by 2 or 3.

let num = prompt("Enter a number");
if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) {
  console.log("The number is divisible by 2 or 3");
} else if (num % 2 == 0) {
  console.log("The number is divisible by 2");
} else if (num % 3 == 0) {
  console.log("The number is divisible by 3");
} else {
  console.log("The number is not divisible by 2 or 3");
}
In this example, we use the || operator to check if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, the condition evaluates to true, and the first console.log statement is executed. If the number is not divisible by 2 or 3, the condition evaluates to false, and the second console.log statement is executed.


Q5: Using Ternary Operator
Print "you can drive" if the age is greater than or equal to 18, otherwise print "you cannot drive". Use the ternary operator.


Congratulations! You have completed the practice set. Now you can move on to the next chapter. -->
